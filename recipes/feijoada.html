<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Feijoada, pronounced <em>fay-jwah-dah</em>, is considered Brazil's national dish.</p>

<p>The name comes from the word <em>feijão</em>, which means bean, an essential ingredient of the dish. Black beans, salted beef and pork come together in a hearty slow cooked stew, traditionally served with rice, collard greens and farofa (toasted manioc flour).</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>You do not need a whole lot of ingredients to make a darn good feijoada. A few pantry staples combined with a few cuts of pork and beef come together to make the most delicious black bean stew you've ever tasted!

</p>

<ul>
    <li>1 pound carne seca (see notes for substitutions)</li> 

    <li>3 large (about 1 pound) smoked calabresa sausages</li>

    <li>2 (about 8 ounces) paio sausages</li>

    <li>5 cups (about 2.2 pounds) dried black beans</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

    <li>6 slices thick-cut bacon, <em>diced</em></li>

    <li>1 large onion, <em>chopped</em></li>

    <li>12 cloves garlic, <em>minced</em></li>

    <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper, <em>to taste</em></li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>The day before you plan on cooking the feijoada, trim the excess fat of all the meats (except the bacon) and place them in a large bowl. Cover with cold water and refrigerate for 24 hours, changing the water 3-4 times, to get rid of the excess salt.</li>
    
    <li>Place the black beans in a separate bowl and cover with cold water. Let them soak overnight in the fridge.</li>
    
    <li>Drain the meat and beans. Place the soaked meat in a large Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot and cover with enough water so they're all submerged. Cook, over medium-high heat, until boiling. Let them boil for 20 minutes, adding more water as needed. Drain and reserve.</li>
    
    <li>Combine the boiled carne seca, beans, bay leaves and orange in that same pot. Pour 2.5 quarts cold water and cook, over medium-high heat, until boiling. Lower the heat to a gentle simmer, cover and cook for 30 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>After 30 minutes, add the sausages. Cover and continue simmering, occasionally skimming the fat that rises to the top, until the meat is tender, about 1.5 to 2 hours.</li>

    <li>Remove the orange and bay leaves. Discard. Remove the meat and sausage and slice into smaller pieces. Reserve.</li>

    <li>Heat the oil in a sauté pan, over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until no longer raw but not yet golden brown, about 3-5 minutes. Add the onion and garlic and sauté until softened and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Add a ladleful of the cooked beans, without liquid, and stir to combine. Using a fork, mash the beans, to release their starch.</li>

    <li>Pour that mixture into the feijoada pot and cook over medium heat, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes or until thickened. If too thick, add more water as needed. Taste and season with salt and pepper.</li>

    <li>Return the meats back to the pot.</li>

    <li>Serve with white rice, collard greens, fried bananas, farofa, vinaigrette salsa and orange slices!</li>
